\item Probability of picking a black ball = $P(B) = \frac{10}{18}$ 
\item Probability of picking a red ball = $P(R) = \frac{8}{18}$
\item Two balls are drawn with replacement. So each event is independent of each other. 
\item Probability that both balls are red 
\begin{align}
&= P(R)P(R) \\
&= \frac{8}{18}\times\frac{8}{18}\\
&= 0.1975
\end{align}
\item Probability that first ball is black and second is red=
\begin{align}
&= P(B)P(R)\\
&= \frac{10}{18}\times\frac{8}{18}\\
&= 0.2469
\end{align}
\item Probability that one ball is black and other is red =
\begin{align}
&= P(B)P(R) + P(R)P(B)\\
&= \frac{10}{18}\times\frac{8}{18} + \frac{8}{18}\times\frac{10}{18}\\
&= 0.4938
\end{align}
