\item 2 is the only even prime number which we can get. Therefore, prbability of getting 2 on a die $= P(A) = \frac{1}{6}$.
\item The number coming up on one die is independent of what comes on the other die.
\item Probability of getting an even prime number (i.e. 2) on both the die $= P(A)P(A) = \frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$.
\item Answer = option (d)
