\item Let the total no. of students be 100. Then no.of students reading Hindi newspapers = 60, no.of students reading Engish newspaper= 40, no.of students reading both English and Hindi newspapers = 20.
\item So, $P(H)= 0.60, P(E)=0.40, P(H \cap E)=0.20$ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Probability that the student reads neither Hindi nor English:
\begin{align}
P(H \cup E)' &= 1- P(H \cup E)\\
&= 1- \brak{P(E)+P(H)-P(H \cap E)}\\
&= 1- \brak{0.60+0.40-0.20}\\
&= 0.20
\end{align}
\item Probability that she reads English newspaper if it is known that she reads Hindi newspaper
\begin{align}
P(E \mid H) &= \frac{P(E \cap H)}{P(H)}\\
&= \frac{0.20}{0.60}\\
&= 0.33
\end{align}
\item Probability that she reads Hindi newspaper if it is known that she reads English newspaper
\begin{align}
P(H \mid E) &= \frac{P(E \cap H)}{P(E)}\\
&= \frac{0.20}{0.40}\\
&= 0.50
\end{align}
