\item Probability that A solves the problem = $P(A) = \frac{1}{2}$
\item Probability that B solves the problem = $P(B) = \frac{1}{3}$
\item A problem is solved when either A or B solves the problem or both solve the problem. So the probability that problem is solved = 
\begin{align}
&= P(A)P(B)' + P(A)'P(B) + P(A)P(B)\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{3}\\
&=0.667
\end{align}
\item Probability that exactly one of them solves the problem = 
\begin{align}
&= P(A)P(B)' + P(A)'P(B) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{3} \\
&= 0.5
\end{align}
