\item Probability that the student knows the answer$ = P(X) = \frac{3}{4}$.
\item Probability that the student guesses the answer$ = P(Y) = \frac{1}{4}$.
\item Probability that the student who guesses the answer will be correct$ = P(C \mid Y) = \frac{1}{4}$.
\item if the student knows the answer then definitely he will be correct. So $P(C \mid X)=1$.
\item using Bayes theorem, probability that the sudent knows the answer given that he answered it correctly:
\begin{align}
P(X \mid C) &= \frac{P(X)\times P(C \mid X)}{P(X)\times P(C \mid X) + P(Y)\times P(C \mid Y)}\\
&= \frac{12}{13}
\end{align}
