\item In answering a question on a multiple choice
test, a student either knows the answer or
guesses. Let $\frac{3}{4}$ be the probability that he knows
the answer and $\frac{1}{4}$ be the probability that he
guesses. Assuming that a student who guesses
at the answer will be correct with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ .
What is the probability that the student knows
the answer given that he answered it correctly?
