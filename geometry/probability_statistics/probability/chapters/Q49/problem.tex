\item Of the students in a college, it is known that
60\% reside in hostel and 40\% are day scholars
(not residing in hostel). Previous year results
report that 30\% of all students who reside in
hostel attain A grade and 20\% of day scholars
attain A grade in their annual examination.
At the end of the year, one student is chosen
at random from the college and he has an A
grade, what is the probability that the student
is a hostlier?
